<h2> Introduction and Part 1 </h2>
</div>

<div align = center>


 <p> Orbital Mechanics involves the force interactions between large 
bodies of mass, governed by the equation
	$$\vec{F} = G\frac{m_1m_2}{|\vec{r}|^3}\vec{r}$$</p>
<br> 
<br>
<p> 
We then applied this equation to a 3 dimensional two body problem. This 
yielded the differential equation system, where the mass of the first body 
is \(m_1\) and the mass of the second body is \(m_2\).
\begin{eqnarray*}
d&=&\sqrt{(z_2-z_1)^2+(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}\\
x_1'&=&v_{x_1}\\
v_{x_1}'&=&\dfrac{m_2g(x_2-x_1)}{d^3}\\
y_1'&=&v_{y_1}\\
v_{y_1}'&=&\dfrac{m_2g(y_2-y_1)}{d^3}\\
z_1'&=&v_{z_1}\\
v_{z_1}'&=&\dfrac{m_2g(z_2-z_1)}{d^3}\\
x_2'&=&v_{x_2}\\
v_{x_2}'&=&\dfrac{m_1g(x_1-x_2)}{d^3}\\
y_2'&=&v_{y_2}\\
v_{y_2}'&=&\dfrac{m_1g(y_1-y_2)}{d^3}\\
z_2'&=&v_{z_1}\\
v_{z_2}'&=&\dfrac{m_1g(z_1-z_2)}{d^3}\\
\end{eqnarray*}
We then used the Runge Kutta 4th order method to numerically solve for 
solutions to the differential equation system using given initial 
conditions. Our code is <a href="orbit2016rk4.txt">here</a>.
<br>
<br>
For our first initial conditions, we had the initial position of body 1 to 
be \(\vec{r_1}=(2,2,0)\) and body 1's initial velocity was 
\(\vec{v_1}=(.2,-.2,0)\). Body 2's initial position and initial velocity 
was \(\vec{r_2}=(0,0,0)\) and \(\vec{v_2}=(-.02,.02,0)\). The mass of 
body 1 was \(m_1=.03\), and the mass of body 2 was \(m_2=3\). With body 1 
in red 
and body 2 in blue, the resulting orbit was:

</p>
<br>
<p> We then applied our code to some new initial conditions, which were 
the same except for the initial velocity of body 1, which was 
\(\vec{v_1}=(.2,-.2,.2)\). The resulting orbit was:

<h4>Part 2: The Three Body Problem </h4>
<p> Expanding to a system of three bodies is actually a pretty 
straightforward process. Only requiring
that we add an additional mass to our system, new coordinates and initial 
conditions for the mass, 
and lastly expanding out equations to take into account the gravitational 
influence of the new mass.</p>

<p> This can be seen in our adapation of the <a 
href="orbit2016.m">orbit2016 code</a> along with some demonstrations
of how the 3 body problem looks.</p>

</video></center>

<p> Now, in both the demonstrations the planets have the same masses, the 
only difference between them is that
we slightly changed the initial velocity of th red planet from 0.2 to 
0.2001 which winds up causing the orbit to degenerate. This incremental 
change causes
the system to fall apart and become unstable. This can  happen to any 
system, of course, but this becomes more and
more likley as more bodies are added making a harder, more stable system, 
less likely.</p>
<br>
<h2> Problem 11 (Part a) </h2>
<p> For the final problem, we were asked to map the orbits of 3 bodies of 
equal mass in three-dimensions 
with a set of given initial conditions. These bodies are supposed to be 
orbiting one another in a 
figure-eight and were first discovered by C. Moore in 1993. Letting the 
masses of each object equal 1, 
the given set of initial conditions were: $$ (x_1, y_1) = (-0.970, 0.243), 
(x'_1, y'_1) = (-0.466, -0.433), 
(x_2, y_2) = (-x_1,-y_1), (x'_2, y'_2) = (x'_1, y'_1), (x_3, y_3) = (0,0), 
$$ and, $$(x'_3, y'_3) = (-2x'_1, -2y'_1). $$ </p>

<p> The function, orbit11, that was used to run this simulation can be 
found, <a href="orbit113d.m"> here</a>. The code 
starts by taking a time interval, number of steps n and the number of 
points per step p, a list of initial conditions 
$$ i.e: [x_1, v_{x_1}, y_1, v_{y_1}, x_2, v_{x_2}, y_2, v_{y_2}, x_3, 
v_{x_3}, y_3, v_{y_3}], $$
and finally the masses of the three objects in the same order as they were 
placed in the position.velocity array.
Orbit11.m calls in trapazoid method to help approximate the orbits of the 
objects. The resulting orbit then 
became (just as at the top of the page),

<h2> Problem 11 (Part b): Changes in Initial Conditions </h2>
<p> For the final problem, we made small changes in the initial 
conditions to test the sensitivity of 
the orbits. We added values of 10<sup>-k</sup> to the velocity, 
x'<sub>3</sub>, where 1&le;k&le;5. By adding 10<sup>-1</sup> to the 
velocity of the third object
we saw that the previous figure-eight orbit was being slowly shifted to 
the right as seen in the video below:
<center><video width="320" controls

</video></center>
<br>
The results from adding and subtracting the other values of 
10<sup>-k</sup> can be seen by the table below:
<table border="1">
<tr>
	
<td>+10<sup>-2</sup></td><td>+10<sup>-3</sup></td><td>+10<sup>-4</sup></td><td>+10<sup>-5</sup></td><td>-10<sup>-1</sup></td><td>-10<sup>-2</sup></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><video width="250" controls source src="problem11b2.mp4" 
type="video/mp4"></td><td><video width="250" controls source 
src="problem11b3.mp4" type="video/mp4"></td><td><video width="250" 
controls source src="problem11b4.mp4" type="video/mp4"></td><td><video 
width="250" controls source src="problem11b5.mp4"

src="problem11b1sub.mp4" type="video/mp4"></td><td><video width="250" 
controls source src="problem11b2sub.mp4" type="video/mp4"></td>
</table>
<br>
As you can see from the videos above, any small fluctiation in the 
initial velocity of the third object will
cause the objects to shift their figure-eight orbit to the left or to the 
right and in most of the cases
still remaining a stable orbit. 

<h2> Orbits in 3-dimensions</h2>

To plot three body orbits in three-dimensions we had to adapt orbit11.m 
to include a z coordinate. This was done
by including more arguments to be accepted for the initial position and 
initial velocity of each object.
Instead of accepting an array of 6 initial conditions, the new code now 
takes in an array of 18 intiail 
conditions. The adapted code can be found, <a href="orbit113d.m"> 
here</a>. The first example can be found at 
the top of the page. A few more examples of the 3-D orbits we created can 
be found below:
